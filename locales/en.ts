          question: "Why pay if it's open-source?",
          answer:
            "Excellent question! The code will always remain free, but maintaining servers, database and infrastructure costs money. Your contribution helps us keep the tool free for everyone. It's a win-win model: you get premium features, the community keeps free access!",

        {
          question: "Can I self-host Workout.cool?",
          answer:
            "Absolutely! The entire codebase is available on GitHub under MIT license. You can deploy it on your own servers, customize it however you want, and use it completely free. Self-hosting gives you full control over your data and workout privacy.",
        },
        {
          question: "Are my workout data secure?",
          answer:
            "Yes! We're GDPR compliant, use encrypted connections, and store your data securely. Plus, since we're open-source, you can audit our security practices. You can also export your data anytime or self-host for complete control.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
          answer:
            "Of course! No contracts, no commitments. Cancel with one click anytime. You'll keep access until your current billing period ends, and you can always restart later. Your workout data remains accessible even if you downgrade to free.",
        },
        {
          question: "Are there exercises for beginners?",
          answer:
            "Definitely! Our exercise library covers all fitness levels from complete beginners to advanced athletes. Videos and instructions help beginners find appropriate exercises, and our video tutorials show proper form.",
        },
        {
          question: "How does progress tracking work?",
          answer:
            "Every set, rep, weight, and time is automatically logged. You get a GitHub-style workout history showing your consistency, plus detailed analytics on volume, progression, and personal records. Premium users get advanced charts and insights.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can I import data from other apps?",
          answer:
            "Soon. We will support CSV imports for basic data (reps & weight). If you're switching from another fitness app, our support team can help migrate your workout history.",
        },
        {
          question: "Does the app work offline?",
          answer:
            "The core workout tracking works offline. You can log sets and reps without internet connection for 10 workouts. Exercise videos and cloud sync require internet connection. All your offline data syncs automatically when you're back online.",

          question: "Are there programs for women?",

        a1: "Different calculators may use different formulas or activity multipliers. We use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which is considered one of the most accurate for most people. However, individual metabolism can vary by 10-20% from these estimates.",
        q2: "Should I eat exactly this many calories every day?",
        a2: "These are average daily targets. It's normal to eat slightly more some days and less on others. Focus on your weekly average rather than being exact every single day. Listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues.",
        q3: "What if I'm not seeing results after following these recommendations?",
        a3: "If you're not seeing results after 2-3 weeks, you may need to adjust. Your actual metabolism might be higher or lower than calculated. Try adjusting by 100-200 calories and monitor for another 2 weeks. Also ensure you're tracking your food accurately.",
        q4: "Are the macro recommendations suitable for everyone?",
        a4: "The 30/40/30 split (protein/carbs/fat) is a balanced approach suitable for most people. However, athletes, people with medical conditions, or those following specific diets (keto, vegan, etc.) may need different ratios. Consult a nutritionist for personalized recommendations.",

        a1: "If you're just starting, use the Basic method. If you know your resting heart rate, use Karvonen by Age for better accuracy. For the most precise zones, use Karvonen with measured MHR and RHR.",
        q2: "How do I measure my resting heart rate?",
        a2: "Measure your pulse for 60 seconds immediately after waking up, before getting out of bed. Do this for 3-5 days and use the average. Normal RHR is 60-100 bpm, with lower values indicating better fitness.",
        q3: "What zone should I train in for weight loss?",
        a3: "The Fat Burn Zone (60-70%) is optimal for burning fat as fuel. However, higher intensity zones burn more total calories. Mix zones for best results - include both fat burn and higher intensity workouts.",
        q4: "How accurate is the 220-age formula?",
        a4: "It's a general estimate that works for most people but can vary by ¬±10-15 bpm. For more accuracy, consider a supervised max heart rate test or use the Karvonen formula with your actual measurements.",
        q5: "Can I train in the VO2 Max zone every day?",
        a5: "No, the VO2 Max zone is extremely intense and should only be used 1-2 times per week for short intervals. Most training should be in the Aerobic and Fat Burn zones to build endurance and allow recovery.",

        "The maximum heart rate is the maximum number of beats per minute your heart can reach during an intense physical effort. It is generally calculated with the formula: 220 - your age. However, this formula can vary by ¬±10-15 bpm depending on individuals.",

      seo_faq_q2_answer:
        "Measure your pulse for 60 seconds immediately after waking up, before getting out of bed. Count the beats for 60 seconds or 15 seconds and multiply by 4. Repeat for 3-5 days and use the average. A normal resting heart rate is between 60-100 bpm.",

      seo_faq_q4_answer:
        "No, the VO2 Max zone is extremely intense and should only be used 1-2 times per week for short intervals (30 seconds to 2 minutes). Most of your training should be in the aerobic zones to build endurance and allow recovery.",
